# Welsh-Anzacs

Project Repo for badly written code for the GOV Hack project in Australia. To find out more watch the 3 min prezzie at
https://prezi.com/vfjt_pf2gbgc/welsh-anzacs/

Note the default branch is 'GovHack15'.  This has been left for judging/Govhack reasons and is not being worked on.
Development is continuing on the 'master' branch which is not default and so you will need to switch to it should you fork this project.

If your interested in working on this project let us know. It needs major tidying up but the idea is there.
